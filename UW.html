            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Hi everyone, my name is Patrick. I am currently a Junior in the Informatics program, with a desire to pursue an HCI track. I was born and raised (for most of my life) in Illinois. I have moved around alot as I have grown however, though I have only lived in Washington for about 3 years or so. I really enjoy this area and the Udub campus is absolutely amazing, I find the architecture both calming and inspiring.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Previous to attending school here I was in the US Army for a number of years and did various deployments around the world, of which I am very thankful to have been a part of. I am huge into travel, I have lived for extended periods of time in 8 different states, yet I have never lived in any one place for more than 4 years at a time. I am also the first person on my mother's side of the family to have been born in the US.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">My avatar within the virtual world <em>Second Life</em> depicts a terminator from the movie <em>Terminator</em>. I chose this avatar because I thought it was a cool reference to an amazing movie franchise and because I think it sparks conversation. When bridging to another world, my view is to make yourself into something that would be cool to be, and in this case that is a terminator (Model T-800). <em><strong>(See below for more)</strong></em></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Random facts: I love the color yellow, I prefer coke to pepsi, and I am into Video Game collecting.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: large;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>About My Avatar:</strong></span></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">a)<strong>&nbsp;Physical Description of my Avatar: &nbsp;</strong>My avatar is both tall and imposing, neither of which my physical person is. I really didn't choose to make my avatar differently than myself on purpose, I just thought the avatar that I chose would be cool to look at and talk about. I chose that of a Terminator (Model T-800) from<em> The Terminator</em>&nbsp;series of movies. I think terminators are cool and therefore thought it would be fun to make my presence into something that would spark conversation and smiles. </span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">As previously mentioned, my avatar is really nothing like my physical person, and I think its fun to be something you could never personally be in virtual scenarios. I actually originally intended for my avatar to be that of another robot (HK-47) from the </span><em style="color: #a6e1ec;">Knights of the Old Republic</em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"> (KOTOR) </span><em style="color: #a6e1ec;">Star Wars</em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"> video game. I am not a huge </span><em style="color: #a6e1ec;">Star Wars</em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"> fan&nbsp;but something about the virtual world leads me to having an affinity for the technological person model. I generally try to run with the first idea that comes into my mind when making non-consequential decisions, and the first that enter my mind was that of a killer robot, and upon browsing the </span><em style="color: #a6e1ec;">Second Life</em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"> Marketplace, I realized the universal appeal of a Terminator lent to it having been created and the more niche appeal of a </span><em style="color: #a6e1ec;">Star Wars</em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"> spinoff series was not, so I went with the Terminator. Overall though I like the idea of robotics because it is strong, solid, and pieces are&nbsp;interchangeable, it really is a more solid alternative to our human&nbsp;bodies.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">b) <strong>P</strong></span><strong style="color: #a6e1ec;">sychological Description:</strong><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">&nbsp;Psychologically speaking I don't believe that my avatar could be farther from belonging in the group or to the Avalumni island. However, that said, I see most people went with these types of ideas as well, belonging by not belonging. My avatar represents the pinnacle of not being part of a group, killer robot and all, but at the same time if amongst a group of other killer robots, it makes perfect sense to be in a group. Generally I would say that in choosing something that is not supposed to natively belong to a group, it sparks conversation and interest because most people do consider themselves non-social creatures or not part of the primary group in one fashion or another. </span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I think that if you showed up to work in the "physical world" dressed as a Terminator, or somehow having your&nbsp;consciousness inserted into a robotic frame, most would find this very off-putting or scary.&nbsp;However, in the virtual space it is not only accepted but lauded for creativity and difference. People generally like the idea of difference but there is only so far one can go in the "<span>physical</span> world" and have it continue to be considered acceptable. In the virtual space one has the freedoms to be whatever they want, and why not? If given the choice to be anything you want, why not choose something that is the pinnacle of it's purpose?</span><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">c) &nbsp;<strong>Sociological Description of my Avatar</strong>: &nbsp;With the avatar I have chosen I have evoked an age old idea of belonging by association. My Terminator has had movies both explaining and fleshing out it's character, both good and bad, but it has already been explored for those who are aware of the movie mythos. This allows me to interact people based upon their own memories and emotions, either good or bad, I have already become distinguished before I said a word. This was not my entire purpose, but it is a good one that I considered when choosing what I wanted to appear as.</span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">By picking a commanding presence in both height, size, and background, it makes it easier for me to interact with my environment and those around me. I have the capability to express intimidation or control simply by existing in the world, not only because I appear as an imposing combatant robot figure, but also because I have a backstory that confirms my avatar's no negotiation/capable nature.</span></p>

            <p><em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><strong>R</strong>eason for taking the class:</span></em></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I took this class because it was available towards the HCI major track with very little knowledge about it at the start. I am rather fascinated by the things that could be learned and applied from this class however and I am very excited to be a part of it.</span></p>
            <p><em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><strong><img style="float: left;" src="https://scontent-b-pao.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/479947_497816213567791_381247493_n.jpg?oh=383547f334987d90c22f60a53a3255e2&amp;oe=54CC14A0" alt="link" width="390" height="497" />E</strong>nergy % you can bring to this class:</span></em></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Honestly, I am not sure. So far I feel very confused about what this class is entirely about, but I am picking things up quickly. Once I get a foothold on exactly what is expected of me though I believe I will be able to produce a great deal of content and be an effective member of my team. I believe in consideration of my course load this quarter I will be able to fully commit 75% of myself to the class.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><strong>S</strong>kills you wish to develop:</span></em></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Generally speaking, the skills I wish to develop in this class are those of understanding. It seems to me that if executed correctly this class could potentially pass on more overall design challenges than any other class I have taken to date.</span></p>
            <p><em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><strong>O</strong>pportunities for using this course in Information Science:</span></em></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I was a little confused as to what this class had to teach upon entering the first class meeting, and maybe even a little afterwards as well. However once I began delving into the reading and looking deeper into the class structure I began to understand the design merits this class has to offer. I believe there are many problems inherent in the structure of design to be learned from the interactive medium as it currently stands. Furthermore, I would risk to say that all real world design and application could be benefitted from more designers (and even consumers) attempting to understand the implications to be learned from a virtual world analysis.</span></p>
            <p><em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><strong>R</strong>ole I would like to take in group projects:</span></em></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">At this point in time I would like to be in more of a worker bee type of role as I feel I may have had less of an understanding of what this class was about from the start of the quarter. I feel moving forward though that I could be effective at any position required of me.</span></p>
            <p><em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><strong>T</strong>echnologies you believe are immersive:</span></em></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I play alot of video games and I believe many of them to be immersive in various ways. Facebook and Tumblr are very different from the video game field, yet are also very immersive themselves. I would say that overall I believe the most<br /> immersive technologies are those that present a reality that is more appealing with them than a reality without them. There are many games I play and many applications/websites I subscribe to on a regular basis, but there are only a few games/sites that I have trouble picturing the overall medium without, and those are the ones that seem the most immersive to me. I think to some extent immersion has a correlation with necessity to me. That if a tool/game/world/idea is immersive enough then it will trump other necessities or override free-time or schedules. I may be off on this assumption or misunderstand the question entirely, but it seems to me that true total immersion only exists with things that still linger in the mind when NOT interacting with it, as if the fictitious world or technology does not need you to continue to function while you are away.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">(<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Ran</strong></span>: &nbsp;<em>This is a very interesting assertion about immersion lingering in your mind when you are not interacting with it. &nbsp;You have to be in flow when you're immersed. &nbsp;If you are still in flow after you are immersed, are you more immersed? &nbsp;I think you could transcend the distinction between virtual and physical. &nbsp;No one really talks about this aspect in the literature. &nbsp;We talk about performance. &nbsp;We are usually referring to observable performance. &nbsp;But, when you are furthering your engagement with the immersive world with your mental capacities, you may be truly integrated with it. &nbsp;So, your choice of a robot as your persona could easily be a psychological implication of your belief about immersive lingering</em>).</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I would say that out of all the virtual worlds I have visited, <em>Dark Souls</em>' (RPG video game released in 2011 for the Xbox 360 and PS3) was the most pervasive in my mind. I used to try to find ways to spend my entire weekend playing and woke up early to try and fit in gaming time before leaving for school in the mornings. The video review I have attached here is a very through and explorative review of the game. Alot of what they say mirrors my feelings on the game exactly. It truly pervaded my waking and resting mind, almost constantly for years! To me this really represents immersion, because psychically I may have been at school, work, or commuting, but mentally I was in Lordran (<em>Dark Souls</em>' world).</span><br /></span></p>

            <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;">Week Eight Presentation</span></span></strong></p>
            <p><em><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;"><span>1. &nbsp;How did you&nbsp;</span><span>personally</span><span>&nbsp;help with the group preparation (like the write</span></span></span></em><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;"> ups)?</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;">In the process of group preparation we were all roughly strong contributors. When we initially began our planning phases we were having a hard time understanding exactly what was required of us or what was expected when it came to presentation vs tour vs written wiki stuff (I am honestly still confused about that), so we made an early decision to work independently from one another and re-convene closer to the presentation date. We all split up and read our individual sections then grouped together at the end to piece it all together.</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;">As far as my personal participation, I believe that I asked alot of questions to make sure we were all on the same track and tried my best during the week that Austin (our team leader) was out, to group everyone up and ask questions as to what everyone wanted to do. It went poorly at first because I made a <a href="/groups/102298">group</a> on Canvas and thought that the messages I sent were being seen, but after a week I realized only some of us saw it and others did not. Despite my confusion about the wiki portion, I also filled out a portion of our <a href="/courses/930308/pages/technical-virtuality-sound-and-image-group-page">group wiki</a> and then tried to adhere to the notes I appended for my part of our overall presentation.</span></span></p>
            <p><em><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;"><span>2. How did you&nbsp;</span><span>personally</span><span>&nbsp;contribute to specific aspects of the group presentation?</span></span></span></em></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;"><span>Previous to implementing our "art house" style presentation area, there was much conversation as to what we wanted to do and where we would present. After doing a lot of discussion about the location and with a rough idea of how we wanted to present Austin created our virtual floor an we moved from there. Ben and Zane appeared to have significant understanding of creation and manipulation within the <em>Second Life</em> world, I on the other hand was very new to it all. We set a day to do the bulk of the creation within the environment and were set to start after the Seahawks game that Sunday. I am not personally a Seahawks fan, nor do I watch many organized sports, so I decided it wouldn't hurt for me to show up early and get started on the layout of our presentation area.</span></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;"><span>I took it upon myself to try and create so simple structure with which to build the area around and tried to set up some directional cues for the audience before everyone else showed up. Mainly this was an effort to help with some organization as I knew there was going to be some confusion upon "calling" an area or where they would be in the bulk of the set up. I set up a sort of directional system and came up with the idea of walking people through it, though given the space and time, it was a decision anyone who was there would have made. Additionally I also came up with the idea of making the area "art house" themed and tried to make sure that everyone was one the same page with that so that we had a semblance of uniformity throughout the presentation.</span></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;"><span>Ben, I believe, did the bulk of the walling off and making the area appear to be indoors, also adding a great art-y wallpaper. Ben also had a really interesting section I thought, very cool and great jump off. Zane came up with the great idea of trying to find, or hosting, a live event to demonstrate sound and image in person. Austin made great references to the course material with his section and kind of pulled everyone together to make sure we were all moving in a relative order. Jose made a reference to Inception in his portion. During my part of the presentation, I made a number of pictures and direct references to my chapters of material. I also attempted to elicit some feedback in response to "Why we use virtual representations of physical instruments?" and also, "Who else could list a band that has connections to some "mind bending" or mentally confusing audio work with the advent of electricity to help them?" I was trying to make connections with the audience that way but it was much harder than I thought it would be to speak about a topic and also monitor incoming messages and additions in such a tight timeframe.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;"><span>All in all I think it all came together pretty well, but because of our planning and misunderstandings as to exactly what was expected at a specific time, we could have done better. I can say for sure that we all were on different time scales and I had a whole extra 3 to 5 minutes left of presentable material, but because of time constraints we were unable to get to. I take the blame on my portion being a little rushed, however everyone's sections went long in our group. We could certainly have benefited from more practice runs, as we only did one beforehand, but overall I feel we got a large part of the message across in an adequate way. I feel pretty good about it, it was just to much information to condense into such a short time period!</span></span></span></p>

            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><em>Class Impressions 11/27/2014 - 12/4/2014:</em></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">No class this week and then tours. So we had no class this last week because it was thanksgiving. Our group continued to struggle with exactly which immersive virtual environment we wished to present in/on. This actually became such a process that we had issues choosing up until almost a day before class. We had a number of leads or directions in which we wanted to go into. We tossed around some ideas like; </span><em style="color: #a6e1ec;">World of Warcraft, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Runescape, Protosphere</em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">, and eventually settled on the Google Suite of collaborative products. I was actually surprised by how the </span><em style="color: #a6e1ec;">Google+</em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"> environment operated and if nothing else, I feel as if it has given me some strong ideas for some future projects and&nbsp;collaborative&nbsp;environment uses.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://spamusement.com/gfx/195.gif" alt="choices" width="640" height="480" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Too many choices CAN be a bad thing sometimes...</em></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">As we tossed around ideas I think it became really clear that a great bulk of virtual environments, at least the popular ones, are game based and therefore primarily function on the Windows OS. This can create a great number of issues as there are more and more students using Apple based technology and some actually opting into not using traditional laptops or computers at all. I have seen more and more people using Surfaces/iPads this quarter and for good reason, its much more price effective and mobile. Personally I prefer a capable laptop to work/interact upon because it feels much more comfortable to me, however I also use a MacBook Pro and even though it is supposedly the more capable of the MacBook line, it still will not run a large majority of the virtual environments we looked over. So I would say this, virtual environments seem much more plentiful on the Windows OS but it doesn't mean that the Mac people are totally out of the loop. This <em>Google+</em> suite was more than capable and fun to use to gather and collaborate with friends/fellow students, and it is cross platform, so win-win.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Our presentation did not go well at all unfortunately, lol. We decided to do breakout sessions in order to make sure everyone could see all the things we had to present, being that the <em>Google Hangouts</em> portion of the tour only allowed for 10 people total for each hangout session. In practice this worked very well, but in application we had alot of issues. While hosting the Google Hangouts portion I immediately had issues with reverb of my own voice making it hard to concentrate and then began to get terrible feedback from a number of mics in the hangout. This then phased into my hearing of students in the other breakout rooms giving their tours or just general discussion, which was needless to say very confusing. Then I lost all audio what-so-ever during the second group of students coming through, shortly thereafter followed by my computer crashing altogether. It was terrible and really showed how an idea can work perfectly in practice, but in application it can fall apart very quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.sportable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/technical-difficulties1.jpg" alt="tech problems" width="450" height="347" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Another Simpsons pic, because it really hits all the notes right. lol</em></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">So with that said there were a number of other very cool tours of which I thought the team that used <em>Habbo</em> was the most inventive and cool. I was honestly just relieved that the&nbsp;embarrassment&nbsp;of having all that equipment failure during my own&nbsp;group's tour didn't happen to anyone else. I had never seen the <em>Habbo</em> environment before but I thought it was simple yet effective and that is a tough line to strike, so I really liked it. To be entirely honest I did not see many presentations in depth after the <em>Habbo</em> one as I began to get a terrible migraine, I actually went to bed the second class ended. I get really bad headaches like that&nbsp;infrequently&nbsp;and they basically stop me from being able to do/enjoy much&nbsp;of anything. So I don't really have a lot else to report on the other tours, though they did seem well put&nbsp;together&nbsp;and neat.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">As I am finishing out the rest of my finals and trying to get ready for the holiday break, I just wanted to say that is has been a very fun quarter and that this wiki might spur me to write my own week to week report of things that have been going on in my life. I know this isn't a new idea but it is certainly the first time I have committed myself to doing it and I have to say it has been kind of fun. This class has&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;expanded my thoughts about a great number of immersive&nbsp;environments and changed the vantage point on which I view them. I don't feel as if I always walk away from a class with a change in view point so I must say that I am pleased and kudos for helping me realize that. I hope whoever is reading this has a great holiday season and a happy new year! Thank you and good night!&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><strong>Week Nine</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><em>Class Impressions 11/20/2014:</em></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Tours, Tours, Tours. So this week was the start of our tours and man was that bar set high right away! I will get into depth here in a second but I gotta say I am hesitant as to whether my group will be able to stand up to such expectations. I think from the start though, there was alot of confusion as to what we were doing. Just to speak a little about my own group, we had had a strong idea of the tour and scripting early on in the quarter and were passionate about showing off one virtual world in specific, <em>Alien: Isolation</em>. This world is the re-imagining of a point in time between the first two <em>Alien</em> movies made famous by Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and of course Sigourney Weaver. **MILD SPOILERS** This virtual world's tale is specifically about Ripley's (Weaver) daughter and her attempts to find her mother drifting in deep space, which was where the ending of the first film left her.&nbsp;<span>**END MILD SPOILERS**</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><span><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://images.thisisxbox.com/2014/11/Alien-Isolation-1XXX.jpg" alt="alien" width="649" height="369" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Aliens have serious drooling problems, they need bibs.&nbsp;</em></span></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">As I mentioned previously, we were very psyched to do this tour and felt good about it. There was some confusion however to what exactly we needed to show, so we asked detailed questions in class, even asking&nbsp;specifically if anyone had to actually be in the world with us, to which we were told no. So we were good to go, but then the next week were told we could not use that environment because no one could join us there. So we are now in the process of choosing a new world, which has been tough, but honestly I think we were all a bit frustrated with the fact that we had this chosen this so far ahead of time, but now we have to relocate. I understand why it is that people have to be there now, but it would have been nice to have known it for a fact a little earlier so we could have prepared more. But it is ok, we will figure something out and happily present to the class next week, but at this point we have no for sure leads. Cutting it a little close, but we work best under pressure right? lol &nbsp;Anyways, on to the tours:<br /></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">First off let me just say that all the groups did a great job, it is not easy to herd people into doing anything the way you plan it from a distance. So I would just like to say that while everyone did an excellent job, there was a clear victor, and my god was that <em>Minecraft</em>! I don't mean to discourage any other group, as the <em>Final Fantasy</em> group didn't even get to present, but we will get to that. It bugs me in society when everyone is given a gold medal just for showing up, I don't believe in it, I think you should get what you earn. The Minecraft group did such a great job of presenting, I mean it was a nearly perfect presentation, incredible really.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Now with all of that said, lets break down specifics, namely the world. <em>Minecraft</em> is incredibly friendly to creationists and also presenters. It lends itself so well that most any other group will have problems replicating that experience in a really comparable way. Now this may have actually given that group a bit of a leg up, but we did all get to choose, in fact it was my first choice from the beginning of this class. I really thought we could have made <em>Alien: Isolation</em> seem new and really unique, seeing as how <em>Minecraft</em> is pretty high profile it just seemed like a no brainer, but also a bit of a boring-ish safe bet. However all of that in mind, the group maximized nearly every conceivable aspect, so its hard to fault them. Just to add as an end cap here, I have built and played extensively in the <em>Minecraft</em> world many times. I have played so long that I have actually gotten weak from forgetting to eat! When does that happen? So just as a note, for those who might not know, what they built would have taken at least a week of directed communication and application of ideas. AT LEAST! That in itself deserves some strong kudos.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.esourceengine.com/downloads/minecraft/14085_minecraft.jpg" alt="minecraft" width="570" height="359" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Diamonds for everyone involved!!</em></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">As far as the tour itself was concerned, it was great. They managed to pack in introductions to nearly every big device/creation in the standardized world. Mining, travel, crafting, housing, combat, it really was all present. These are not only important elements of the tour, but it is important to highlight that in a world where the point of it all can get a little lost, that they highlighted most all of the base concepts of the bigger things the game is all about. However all that said, none of it would matter without some passion or caring behind the tour, and that they had. Story, that was the key behind their tour. They lead us on an adventure of understanding, even factoring in combat at the end AND and after celebration!! I mean really, I was talking to my team after that presentation and literally said, we can't beat that, that was perfect. lol</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">So the next group, I am not even sure I want to say anything here, because they really didn't get to present. I feel it should be noted though, that they had a great idea to present in a beautiful world with great lush history. They would not have had the ability to really manipulate the environment in the same manner as the last group did, so that already should be noted. I think the only thing I really want to say is that they handled the fact that they were not allowed to present well. I think that it is a shame that they were cut off, especially when they will never be able to get a un-numbered extent of the class into the world because of hardware constraints (namely that it is a windows only game). The part about that that bugs me is that it is discounting a large amount of great worlds simply because everyone is not capable, or not willing, to enter them. I think something I should mention is that I was not there for the <em>Minecraft</em> tour, I was only watching. While I own the game on a few consoles, I did not own it on the computer. So I guess what I really want to say is that I will flesh this out more when they get to present for real.</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://assets.vg247.com/current//2013/04/Final-Fantasy-XIV-beta-30.jpg" alt="marlboro" width="622" height="354" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Our hero is shown here fighting a Marlboro. Smoking is bad for you. lol</em></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">The last group of the night presented to us within <em>Steam,</em> a computer gaming platform that is accessible from both the windows and mac hardware. This was a very confusing idea to me, as I had used <em>Steam</em> before I never really spent alot of time in the shopping/social media portion of the application. I was pretty surprised, but not shocked, at the marketplace that is the&nbsp;entirety&nbsp;of <em>Steam</em>. It was a smart choice to present within simply because everyone was able to easily install it on their systems, it is un-invasive, and it is also something most computer savvy people are aware of. While I do extend them kudos to their smart choice, it is a little hard to differentiate alot of their content of that within a regular 2D presentation.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Their engagement with those being toured was not bad, there was alot of back and forth dialogue between the presenters and they spoke to us in a way that was easy to understand. I feel like the overall was well put together and that it was interesting information to know. They sought out record/contextual information for us, like the highest sold key and what amount, those things tend to ground the virtual world in the mind a little more I find. By offering up legacy data illustrating how popular something is, it re-enforces&nbsp;to those listening that this is important and&nbsp;you should pay attention, at least from a psychological standpoint. Other than that, I congratulate them on putting the whole thing together, as it probably was a bit of a feat to explain why this interface was an&nbsp;environment&nbsp;to&nbsp;tour. So kudos team!</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.twinfinite.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Steam.jpg" alt="steam" width="610" height="347" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>The extractor of every PC gamer's money from their wallets, their logo should actually be a vacuum.</em></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">That is the collected impressions I had from the first week of tours. I thought they were fun and that they were pretty cool to see. I liked the interaction, and&nbsp;specifically the narrative built into the <em>Minecraft</em> tour.&nbsp;Very cool stuff and very smart people. I am proud to be within this group of intelligence and creativity, keep up the great work all!</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><strong>Week Eight</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><em>Class Impressions 11/13/2014:</em></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Presentations, presentations, presentations. This week we had a ton of presentations, including my group's own presentation, so I would like to take some time and address each of them individually. While there was a bevy of information to be garnered from each presentation that I could touch on, I feel it is more important to me to focus on an overall sense of what the presentation left me with. Overall I think everyone did an amazing job and given our presentation limits/how we were allowed to present, I think everyone was really inventive and presented in such varied ways that just the set up is enough to comment on. I think it was actually one of my favorite classes this quarter, all the variation was much appreciated in a 3 hour class during the night time. lol</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ZUSyTZxB--/188ysybz7a5n6jpg.jpg" alt="public speaking" width="565" height="321" /></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #a6e1ec;"><em>This is a daunting place to be. Did you know that public speaking ranks above death in public fears? Pretty crazy.</em></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">The first presentation of the night was group 2 and their topic was the "<a href="/courses/930308/pages/psychology-and-perception-of-avatars-group-page"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Psychology and Perception of Avatars</span></a>" presented within the virtual world of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. I really thought this was a cool idea of the way we address avatars and how we identify with them as being either important or not/how we separate them from the NPC crowd. I think the background music was a cool backdrop to the visuals we were introduced to and the presenter's voiceover, however after a mic hand off or two it started to become difficult to hear a few of them speak. I eventually had to drop the background music in order to hear the presenters talk, but it still had an interactive input within the virtual world because Final Fantasy is classy like that.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">My group was actually planning to present using <em>Twitch</em>, in the same manner as the group who presented here, but the delay between command input and actual streaming broadcast was jarring enough that we may need to re-think that plan. I think that this group did a great job of keeping things together even though they were aware that we were being pulled from the experience due to lag related issues. This group had a strong cohesive message and I barely noticed the hand off from one presenter to another, which I think is a great thing.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Next we had group 8 and their topic the "<a href="/courses/930308/pages/future-of-virtual-reality-slash-presence-group-page"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Future of Virtual Reality/Presence</span></a>" presented in a split room format within Sococo. While we had seen this presentation tactic before with group 5, I believe, it worked out very well and I think led to meaningful discussion. I honestly cannot recall alot of the subject matter, but I think it was presented well and brushed upon alot of interesting topics. For this group specifically I think that the burden was greatest. The group being mainly concerned with the future landed itself in the unfortunate arena of having to do alot of lead up explanation to set the scene before it could address what was to change. This is complex mainly because of the limited timeframe being split between the present and then how the future would differ.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">In one portion we were shown a segment of an episode of <em>To catch a Predator</em>, which is a now cancelled TV show about entrapping guys attempting to rendezvous with underage women. The point that I understood as being the main point they were illustrating was whether we felt for the guy being caught in the episode. Though I am not entirely sure I understood what we were being asked. These are difficult subjects to really get invested into and give any strong conversation one way or another because of the limited timeframe. The timeframe limitations I am alluding to, along with some mic issues for a few of the presenters, held back some of the presentation I felt. Overall though I liked the set up and felt there was a lot to gain from the smaller group, more involved presentation strategy.</span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Third, we were introduced to group 7 and their topic "<a href="/courses/930308/pages/virtual-technology-and-applications-group-page"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Virtual Technology and Applications</span></a>" presented with a sort of Presi presentation. This was a really cool presentation layout, I enjoyed all of the zoom ins and zoom outs to get to the separated portions of the presentation. It was fun to hear about the different sections and how it all interconnected. However, I would say that this was not a very interactive presentation and that is not a bad thing, just not a great thing for this specific class and what the guidelines were (as I understand them anyway). I will say, though, that even though this was a less interact-able type of presentation it probably had the most raw knowledge out of any other presentation from this class, which is a great thing.</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I had similar problems with my portion of my group's presentation, but the format and time restrictions of these presentations prevent to much in depth knowledge to be passed on about any specific subject and does more to just highlight that people read in the book. I think this was a great presentation because it actually tried to really teach us some things in the amount of time that was given. However, the timing, and after two more interactive presentations before it, cloud my memory as to exactly what all was attempting to be passed on to us.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/files/29166649/download?download_frd=1&amp;verifier=D7h3SI3n7GTmgvPCMr6YHuUSD3F71fydRiSCzZS8" alt="group 7" width="443" height="348" /></span><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><em><span style="font-size: small;">Small excerpt from the text (I think)</span></em></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">The last group of the night was group 1 and his topic "<a href="/courses/930308/pages/history-and-foundations-of-virtuality-group-page"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">History and Foundations of Virtuality</span></a>" presented in <em>Second Life</em>. First off let me say, I am not sure how this came about to have only one person in this group, but you would have likely not known it was only one person from the set up of it all! I give strong kudos to David Yun for having put all of that together himself and finding a strong way to interact with the audience. I am not sure where he was getting those questions from, but it was fun to see the movement of the pie chart when we answered. lol</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I think that having a singular object as part of a presentation created not only a focused vision about what he wanted to say, but also served to show a strong insight on his end about how to control crowds. By emplacing a singular re-usable object and changing the context of the object's use, he effectively controlled all of our actions within a small space and it all worked pretty fluidly. I thought the voting premise was pretty cool, though I am a little confused about what seemed like somewhat random questions, even though the answers were on the line graph thing that he gave us to use as reference material. Because of the way it worked as intended (I assume), the restrictions he had on people/help, and how well he handled the crowd (at the end of the class no less), I may have to award him the overall best presentation. Though a lot of the normal annoyances involved in group work was avoided by being a one man team so to speak, I think just the fact that I remember it so well that late at night after a gauntlet of presentations and active listening before it, deserves some strong praise. lol :)</span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">That covers all the groups, minus my own, that presented this week. After seeing what everyone did I am kind of excited to see the next few weeks and what everyone's tours will look like. The only closing thing I would elaborate on going into the future for this class, there needs to be more separation between what the difference between these presentations and tours are. Up until two weeks before we were to present I thought they were the same thing, then after doing the separate presentation and scheduling our group tour, I am still rather confused about what the big differences are. Maybe the presenting inside of a world is a bit to complicated or blurred exactly what we were doing to me, or maybe I am just confused overall. I understand them both and what is different about them now, but it took me quite a bit longer to understand than I would have anticipated.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><strong>Week Seven</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><em>Class Impressions 11/6/2014:</em></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">The joy of creation. This week we did some programming with Vex, did a ton of work on our group presentation, and I met Ran IRL at a veteran's panel. It was a pretty jam packed week full of unusual activities in my day to day life. I want to break each of these events down and just try to flesh out some story material, so here we go.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Vex, I think he should sue Bungie for using his name for the bad guys in their new game, was a very interesting and attentive guest speaker. I have been looking for links in this class and the bulk of the other Informatics courses in order to ascertain where this one fits amongst the group. Having this connection with programming in the class finally kind of brought all of it around I thought. I have had my frustrations with UI/UX when it comes to <em>Second Life</em>, and thought that to have been the biggest tie to other classes that I have this quarter, or even projected courses I have upcoming. This class is very unique in that it is covering things that I believe only high level video gaming programmers/level designers have had to deal with. There is no "How to make a hit MMORPG 101" class to be offered, but honestly it seems to me that more than anything else thats what this class is showing to me. It's design on a much deeper and harder to manage level. It's like Apple's philosophy of limitation equalling better design. It can be very difficult to manage attention, timing, and delivery. Teaching a class in a virtual world is like trying to teach fifth graders anything at a theme park, its an constant active fight for attention and pacing. But, back to Vex, I got a small amount of what he was trying to teach, but when I started working on the things he was showing us, I got a little lost in trying to figure it out. It was fun, but I probably actively learned less than I normally would have in a sterile environment. That could be in part to my insane scheduling last Thursday though (2 interviews, 2 classes, and a 3 hour veteran panel right before a 3 hour class, do not a active mind make).</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-t_8bICcEt_E/USFxmQrlBGI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/UTi--CIazHM/s640/cabal-concept-art-destiny.jpg" alt="vex" width="640" height="360" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>The Vex, as seen in Destiny. I wonder if maybe they are related through a distant cousin? lol</em></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Our presentation has been shaping up nicely this week. I feel we will have alot of information to impart and I feel it is insightful in many ways. Now while I cannot give away the content quite yet, anyone can visit it! We have an art house museum in the clouds as it were. What was originally a floating slab of metal, has now morphed into a sort of art house devoted to sound and image. I am very impressed by what we made in such a short time, and while I don't feel that my portion is the best to be presented, I do feel that everyone contributed and that we have created a pretty cool overall virtual feel of a physical world place. I feel like the vibe is consistent with the inception-like ideas of putting virtual-ness deeper and deeper into context. It's a place in a virtual world speaking about virtual things that most see as non-virtual addressed and blanketed in the guise of a physical world place that also peers into virtual places through similar means. lol. Thats a mouthful! I guess I am saying that I think its pretty cool that is was made as it is and I hope that it will continue to float there after we leave the class.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I attended a panel today for the iDiversity people with the basis of trying to understand veteran's as a diverse group. I was invited by Ran and I was pleased to meet him there. We started by Ran, who was the leader of the group, asking us what we all knew about/how we would describe the veterans of the last few great wars in recent memory. I felt like it was a great way to start the discussion and really was interesting to hear the terms coined for them. Though no war is a war that I want to fight, I honestly feel very lucky to have been a part of the one I did serve in. I am part of a generation that is largely understood and acknowledged for the sacrifices we all have made. Not many past wartime soldiers/sailors/airmen/marines can really make that claim. It's a sad thing to think back and realize that you are so much more fortunate than those that came before you, but there is little anyone can do about that now other than continue to recognize past sacrifices. I told Ran that I was a bit self-conscious to speak in front of people, but I was pleased to find that this meeting was rather small and informal.</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/35/e7/74/35e774251a3599d4d774d3059674cf79.jpg" alt="seuss" width="473" height="327" /><em><span style="font-size: small;">Oh the places you'll go...</span></em></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">This is kind of verging into a bit of personal territory, or maybe just personal beliefs, but an individual at the panel made a reference to his veteran roommate having PTSD and wondering how he should treat him or what he should say. I didn't say anything at the time because I like to make sure to think about the ramifications my words may have before making a broad sweeping statement about other people and how they may feel. This student was from Chile and he spoke of many differing understandings of soldiers and war from his home country. So this is my poorly timed response to him, just leave him alone and treat him like everyone else. I truly believe that the gift of allowing someone to not be acknowledged is one of the greatest gifts that one can give. You hear about it from celebrities all the time, and to a much less extent from soldiers, and it truly is a problem of the 1%. It's an invisible isolator, so much so that virtually no one is aware of it. There is no worse feeling than identifying yourself as something that you are or have done, and having that thing replace your identity. I personally don't feel segregated or treated differently, and that is important to me, though some are quick to label others and put them in a certain box so to speak. This is not only hurtful, it is a barbaric way of seeing people. We don't learn that way as a society. Now I want to take the time to say, that I am not putting this on the student. He simply did not know if there was a different protocol he was unaware of to deal with the situation. AND THAT IS OK. We all have ignorance in one way or another and his was not only normal, but respectful, because he only wanted to facilitate those around him. I just wanted to say that, to anyone who may read and pass the message along. Service in any form, be it military/volunteer work/government/diplomacy, should be acknowledged (possibly thanked, if that is your stance) and then just added to an existing person's character. Thats all. So mini-rant over, and my words here are not in any anger or non-diplomatic leaning, simply just answering a question that I was unable to answer.</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">"I would just like to add that upon re-reading this that if someone is in pain or expresses to you that they need help or that they may not have control of themselves mentally/emotionally/physically (or that you have an intuition based gut feeling that something is wrong), please please seek out help. I only make the statements above because I felt out the situation and I felt that the student was merely asking in order to better understand, not out of fear of the person hurting themselves or anyone else. I just want to make that clear though, if something feels wrong it probably is, and you lay that across all of life."</span></em></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Xm0X5wEr_oM/VByNMT8AAoI/AAAAAAAAhqc/alpH5tGB24o/s1600/First%2BBlood%2BHandsy.jpg" alt="rambo" width="508" height="289" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Poor Rambo, he just wanted to be left alone...</em></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">All that said, I had a cram packed week. I have actually had alot of people ask me recently if they should take this class. EVERYONE seems to be curious about it, lol. I generally have only kind words to say about my experience, simply adding to them that the abstractness of the general course elements may not apply quite as much to their day to day work experiences as maybe some others might. I feel this class will be taught everywhere, and for most majors, within the next 20 years. I think this type of understanding or what is right, wrong, or frowned upon in regard to one's virtual-ness, will only become more and more interesting and exciting as time rolls on. Until that point however, I think that alot that we learn here can be hard for the layman to absorb in the intended fashion. I may be biased however as a significant portion of my life has been spent away from my physical body in mind if not emotion. So maybe this is very simple and poignant for everyday life and I just have more trouble grasping it than most. At any rate though, I have given it a strong review for new students. New meat for the grinder. lol. (<em>Starship Troopers</em> reference) :)</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><strong>Week Six</strong></span></strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><em>Class Impressions 10/30/2014:</em></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I was absent from class this week, so let's see what we have to discuss. I was unable to attend class this week because of originally booking a seminar with possible job/intern opportunities that I had to attend in order to better understand my possible prospects in the design world. I thought it was slated for a Friday night when I confirmed I would be there, and in fact I am somewhat convinced it may have changed after I booked it, but in the end it didn't matter because life does not wait for you when there are family issues. So instead of missing the first third of class and catching up with everyone else from campus, I instead found myself speeding through traffic to get home as quickly as possible. After alleviating the situation and ensuring everything was going to be ok for the next hour or so, I slipped into class closer to 8 than the 7 I had anticipated. Sadly this forced me to miss virtually the entire class and what sounded like some really cool tours to see.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">So what do I have to talk about? I wasn't present for class and there was no reading assignment that I am aware of that is separate from the material to be covered during my group's presentation. So what I can do is speak a small amount on what I did overhear in the class despite not being present at the same place and time in <em>Second Life.&nbsp;</em>Also, despite not being present, I do know the itinerary and so I thought I might discuss a little of the real world applications of "wearables."</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/66317197/wearabletech.jpg" alt="wearables" width="488" height="289" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>What comes to mind when you hear the word wearable?</em></span></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">While I missed most of the class itself, including the tutorial and creation of wearables themselves, I did catch some audio regarding what sounded like a train station of some sort. It intrigues me from the way it was described that people take ownership over portions of the <em>Second Life</em> virtual world and that it can be connected to other portions of other's owned spaces. When I entered the room, I was listening to Raven discuss the train station area and how it was kind of a legacy area that apparently connected different areas to each other. This is interesting to me because if an avatar wanted to travel from one location to another it would normally not be hindered by straight line distances and travel through areas, but if we wanted to see all the area in between would we have to have permission to traverse another's land? I found it to be a pretty interesting idea but alas having not been actually present there, it is hard to determine whether this is a correct assumption or not.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">On to wearables and the crazy future of mobile computing that we appear to be at the doorstep of unleashing. While I personally do not own a <em>Google Glass</em> it appears to be the top ringer in trying to bridge the computing and living experiences. This is a fascinating device with unlimited possibilities but is it something we need? Augmented reality, or the bridging of the "<span>physical</span> world" and the virtual world, can display all kinds of pertinent data on the area surrounding us. This data could very well prove to be great information for a tourist or someone sightseeing in their own city, but is there much need in the country or in nature? This is a question that can really only be answered by the user themselves, but what about the people that interact with the users?</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E-uqTphmvlM/U36UVO-W4_I/AAAAAAACF2k/OPzg-bacCX0/s1600/google+glass.jpg" alt="google glass" width="571" height="326" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Google Glass: form and function combined or creepy invasion of privacy?</em></span></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Having already been banned by movie theaters and causing a bit of discomfort amongst friends and any other people who may come into contact with the wearer of the device, <em>Glass</em> does not appear to be off to that great of a start amongst the general populous. Most of this is related to the fact that a <em>Glass</em> has the ability to record the events taking place around the user with limited amounts of feedback given to what, or whom, may be in the process of being recorded. Its a shame that one feature amongst a bevy of others could create so much turmoil, but in my opinion, this is more of a stigma against the idea of the further combination of man and machine than it is real world concerns of being constantly recorded. If executed correctly I believe that most people will be more accepting of the idea of a constant wearable that enhances lives, however the correct combination/design to execute these desires has yet to be realized, sorry Google.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">However lets get on to the what we ALL really wanted, <a href="http://www.nerdist.com/2014/11/intels-prize-winning-wearable-is-a-selfie-taking-drone-that-lives-on-your-wrist/">a selfie taking robot</a>! Thats right, the <em>Nixie</em>, is a slap bracelet style wearable that unfolds into a smallish spy copter and when used hovers above the user and captures all those selfies we could never get ourselves. While to alot of us this may sound exceedingly silly, it really does have alot of real world purpose. Imagine never having to ask someone to take a picture of you, or your friends and you, again. This small wearable could change the way we think of photography in one fell swoop, that is if it is successful. <em>Nixie</em>, is still in the development stage, unlike the <em>Google Glass</em> which is currently in field testing.</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/110314_IntelWinners_Nixie-970x545.jpg" alt="nixie" width="573" height="325" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Nixie: the future of picture taking?</em></span></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">However, <em>Nixie</em> is not spared from controversy either. If used innocently it could capture any of the exciting moments in one's life that would have been lost to time. If used in a predatory manner though, the device could invade homes or second story windows to capture all sorts of personal data and moments. The idea of spy cams, even ones attached to hover copters, is far from a new idea, but the thought of having one constantly around your wrist wherever one could go is a troubling idea if used irresponsibly. As it seems to be the case with any device however, wearable or not, the applications of the device are in the eyes of the user, but at what point do the non-user's have the right to not have these futuristic devices invade their space? The questions involving <em>Nixie</em>, <em>Google Glass</em>, and indeed all wearable technologies will have to be left up to the courts and the populace to decide, as the point when one's rights interfere with another's is their business.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Class Impressions 10/23/2014:</span></em></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Presentations from the masses, for the masses. This week we focused on the students of our class presenting information to the rest of us for a change. By and large, the presentations were very well done and forced a good amount of interaction from those of us who were learning. By design it appeared that all the groups were successful in presenting their assigned subjects and presented them in different and creative ways. Without any intervention from the forces in control, as far as I know, everyone presented different information and in different ways. It was pretty cool to see everyone else taking the incredibly dry and somewhat unpalatable data in the book and giving it some informational context to the rest of us. I would like to spend a little bit of time discussing what I recall and what I learned from each presentation.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://jeanporter.cmswiki.wikispaces.net/file/view/math%20cartoon...andertoons.PNG/466016212/334x249/math%20cartoon...andertoons.PNG" alt="math solution" width="334" height="249" /><em><span style="font-size: small;">The laziest people are normally the smartest, lol.</span></em></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;">The first presentation encountered some problems that are a great lesson to the rest of us, screen share does not capture audio natively. The group had chosen to present their findings with a neat kind of synthesizer that made their voices appear to be more mechanical than they actually were. In itself this would have been fine and fitting with the course material, however I have some caveats. There is a reason that when a broadcaster or professional presenter is planning to appear in front of a camera or behind a mic there is a specific cadence and tone with which to speak, it holds your attention. The monotone sound of the presented dialogue in combination with the slight distortion and slight lag based delays, both graphically and verbally, caused me to remember virtually nothing from the presentation. I tried various times on my own end to either focus on the slides or just try to follow the voices but I felt like I kept getting lost in the way it was presented. It just did not connect with me in a way that I can quantify. Now I know this was not the intention of the presenters, and that&nbsp;unforeseen things happen when presenting a&nbsp;pre-formatted&nbsp;presentation&nbsp;live, but the end result was that I missed virtually all of it.&nbsp;<br /></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;">The second presentation was very interesting in that is split into different groups and made references to real world or recent technological issues with which I either had personal experience or overheard lots of media coverage. I really liked the way they got everyone participating and it made me feel involved in the learning process. However, because of the nature of the way things were presented I am not sure I walked away with a lot of new knowledge. An&nbsp;inherent issue with presenting media coverage or popular interest topics, is that everyone has knowledge coming into the situation and because of that preset knowledge it is that much harder to try and sculpt it into something uniform by the end of a presentation. Ideally, of course, no one would know anything about what was being presented ahead of time and a group could sculpt that nothingness into something specific by the end of what is being presented. This is, however, not normally the case and is a common&nbsp;occurrence&nbsp;when trying to get others to walk away&nbsp;with a&nbsp;specific&nbsp;new set of knowledge after presenting. However, this group was smart in putting their contribution to the combined learning of the class together, by offering options when choosing what topics interested the listener. This simple and small addition not only broke the class into smaller and more&nbsp;manageable groups but also allowed the listener the ability to shape one's own learning. Great idea and I hope more groups look into it in the future.</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;">The last presentation of the night was presented entirely in <em>Second Life</em>. I thought it was additionally interesting that they chose to give the presentation within our island's lecture hall area. I know this may seem counter intuitive but it is the last place I would give a presentation. Not to speak down upon the group, I think it was an interesting set of information and I think it was presented wonderfully. I do feel, though, that as most look to a virtual world they envision the things that they cannot do in the <span>physical</span>&nbsp;world. I notice that most everyone flies right away in <em>Second Life</em>, as soon as they figure out how to do so. Rightly so, it is&nbsp;congruent&nbsp;to logical thinking to push boundaries in virtual worlds. This freedom of movement within the world lead me to want to leave or roam around the environment. We had voice through <em>Sococo</em> so it was really not entirely necessary to sit directly in front of the presenters. I found that I was getting distracted looking at avatars and staring around the virtual world, though I am a little ADHD so that may play a small part in it. lol. Overall though, the group presented great and I was interested in how they kept us all actively listening despite the freedoms of the virtual world and despite it being the last 20 minutes of a 3 hours class held in the later night time. This is a difficult environment to present in from the start, merely because of the class time, its a solid competition for attention both from the presenter, and within the listener.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;">All in all, this was a fun mix up to the normal class narrative and one that I enjoyed seeing and passively contributing in. My observations about the groups is that they were generally all engaged, actively trying to do different things, and on the ball as far as time frames and group participation are concerned. Despite some pretty considerable confusion about deadlines and general misconceptions, I have really enjoyed the direction this class has taken. I think everyone has pulled together to create a group dynamic not often seen in most classes farther along in the quarter, and to add those classes are in the "<span>physical</span> world". Its incredible how with the expanding of some simple understandings of what a class room composes of and how it relates to the learning experience. I know I am certainly impressed by how little it really seems to matter at this point in the class. Everyone seems to know where to go and when to go there, and also everyone seems actively engaged in the subject matter in a way that respects one's fellows.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><span><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I know from the comments below that my week four impressions apparently stuck well and also that Mr. Hinrichs seems to enjoy my angle on understanding immersive environments. However, the reason as to why my insights were so deep last week was because I delved into some personal thoughts and impressions. I believe that this week there is little for me to delve into because I don't have any personal experience with anything that was expressed this week. </span></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><span><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I have alot of views around virtuality, I have grown up more virtually than probably most anyone else in this class, including those who were born into a more technological world from the start. The difference is I have been raised on video gaming environments, most specifically RPG's, <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">therefore rather than living a singular "real" life and a few virtual ones based upon myself, I have lived thousands of lives and virtually none of them my own. This may be a solid point of discussion at a later point in time, the difference between a virtual representation of yourself and a virtual representation of someone else you inhabit. I guess this is, however, the nature of role playing. </span></span></span></span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: small; background-color: #ffffff;">(highlighting by Suzette)</span></em></strong></span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Manipulation of objects in the 3rd dimension. We moved around and reimagined some items in the <em>Second Life</em> world this week. It was fun to see everything that you can do within the FREE use of <em>Second Life.</em> Despite my distaste for the User Interface (UI) that represents your avatar's ability to interact with the other virtual surroundings, I generally find <em>Second Life</em> to be a very impressive virtual world. After I saw what was possible with the design and objects tools this week I was very impressed with what else could be done with this virtually open space. It is pretty incredible if you think about it, excellent platform for innovation.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">There was a reference made to a comment in my RESORT analysis this week and I thought it might be great or interesting to continue to expand things.</span><em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"> The portion from above basically just explained that my personal belief is that the most immersive worlds for me satisfied a few conditions; that the world did not need me to exist (which is either a result of the constant witness to or reference of its existence) and that the world continues to exist when I am not present (the world is ever-changing and events continue to transpire despite, or possibly in direct response, to my not currently interacting with it/having it interact with me). </span></em><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Despite the similarity to my descriptive sentences above there are very different aspects of those two portions of the alternate reality.</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">The world not needing me to exist in order for it to exist is a very big indicator that the world is an important one to be investigated. I find that there are levels of immersion that are comfortable, or tolerable, to most people. I personally do not overly enjoy being totally immersed in, for instance <em>World of Warcraft (WoW)</em>, because for a passive player of MMORPG's they can appear and exhibit and near endless to do list of actions that it becomes work in itself. That level of immersion is unsatisfactory to me because the real time movement and sheer amount movement actually tend halt my immersion through monotony. Now before the <em>WoW&nbsp;</em>try to gang up on and kill me, I played <em>WoW</em> for quite some time before I quit, lol. It is an excellent game in every right and thats why, in the sheer face of the things that pull me out of the game, that its one of the most immersive experiences available. The environment is so immersive that despite my non-desire to play it continues to present itself to me through various outlets and friends. Despite my attendance I am privy to events transpiring in places, and in ways, I can only imagine. It has literally occupied a portion of my mind without paying rent and contributing little, yet it is important and "existent" enough that I must acknowledge it.</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://daszynski.org/videos/thumbs/misc_humor/leeroy_jenkins_thumb.PNG" alt="WOW leeroy" width="1095" height="758" /></span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Which brings me to my next point, a truly immersive environment will continue to change when I am not present. Environments are always shifting in reality so why should a virtual world be any different? Just because the code has already been laid does not mean that there is no need for change or evolution. I find that upon existing within a world that will continue to improve, or downgrade, around you adds to immersion in many unspoken and integral ways. First, there is never an end; there is never a perceived place or state of completion. This is a driver in many virtual environments to determine the time spent until exiting, having "completed" the world. Second, it inspires you to want to return; when you have existed, you know you will continue to exist remotely in another world without any actual/immediate interaction/intervention from yourself. It should be noted in this sense that I do not refer to Flash based games like&nbsp;<em>Farmville&nbsp;</em>or even more retail passive games like&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing.&nbsp;</em>Both of these games highlight a trend of rationing out portions of a total whole of content, that only more accurately "unlocks" to you as the player/occupier of the world space. Third, it inspires you to discover and take note because the virtual landscape will never be set; constant changes prevent the formation of "horse blinders" or tunnel vision in which you will become disconnected with things you perceive as static. Anywhere you have been that never changes becomes comfortable quickly and leads to gaps in memory through lack of attentiveness towards one's surroundings. This is poison to immersion (at least in my opinion) because it causes a loss of attention and detail searching within a set number of visits or hours attended, dependent on the individual person interacting.&nbsp;<em><br /></em></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Above I made references to the PS3/Xbox 360 exclusive video game <em>Dark Souls</em>, a very immersive game in my opinion and based upon my criteria. Upon <em>Dark Souls</em> release I was unaware of the game. It was a chance rental that made me learn of it. It is a medieval fantasy game based in a world referred to as Lordran. When compared to my first criteria&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em> was a game, that while I had not heard of its existence before attending, I continued to learn about from auxiliary sites based upon the game, i.e., wikis and gaming news sites. It became so invasive in the "real" portions of my life that I began to find myself thinking of the game rather excessively in the waking hours of my day. A side effect of discovering the game in the way that I did was that I had no real understanding of, or view of, the game from another's prospective. As I learned more during the non-gaming portions of my day, I found that each time I came back to the game I looked at it differently and with new found vigor/determination to better myself. This love affair lasted over two years. Though the game world itself was relatively set, through gained knowledge in the "<span>physical</span> world", I was changing to suit the game, so I could achieve more there. That is absolutely astounding, I have been playing video games since the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), through virtually my entire life I have been living thousands of other lives in virtual planes, yet this is the game that sticks with me. This is the reality that was finally able to shape me to it, rather than it shaping to me. I truly believe that in our lifetimes, while everything is vying for our attention, everything is trying to consume us mentally, the things that make it through are that much more important for it.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>

            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><em>Class Impressions 10/9/2014:</em></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I FINALLY was able to change the "skin/wearable" of my avatar! Upon first entering this class I was unaware of a lot of things. One of those things was the nature of the class, or the fact that we were to be meeting within an online environment. After gaining an understanding of what was expected in the realm of attendance and the online places we would meet, I immediately began trying to customize my avatar. I am generally the guy who, at the beginning of a new video game or meeting in a new online place for the first time, spends hours trying to make everything look cool and trying to reflect myself in the avatar that will represent me. It's not a matter of trying to stand out or be different really, I just wish to try and reflect the person I am early so that I feel the avatar accurately represents who I would wish to be in that world. I LOVE customizing stuff in most every electronic setting I inhabit, I am also the guy who spends the whole time playing&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>&nbsp;in the menu trying to build my house in an awesome way.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">So initially upon understanding all the class expectations and getting all my programs configured and working on my laptop I set out to customize my avatar. I could speak volumes about how the&nbsp;<em>Second Life</em>&nbsp;UI for manipulating what you wear and how you look is so terribly designed, but I will only brush on what is pertinent. Before the first class, I was trying to manipulate my avatar's appearance and eventually gave up out of frustration. Before the second class, I spent hours on wiki's and looking over videos trying to figure out where I went wrong only to once again quit out of anger and time constraints. It should not be this hard to simply make your avatar look differently!! It is simply poor design and terrible redesigns based off of, what I would assume was, tons of poor user feedback. Finally, after weeks of trial and error, making my avatar disappear from removing items, resetting my avatar back to default, and giving up caring whether my avatar reflected me or not, one paragraph of information from Suzette fixed my avatar and allowed me to finally appear as the unstoppable killing robot I always knew I could be.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://popcritica.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/terminator-t-800-exoskeleton.jpg" alt="terminator" width="586" height="317" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>T-800 exoskeleton</em></span></span>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">The main point of this post is to highlight the frustration and anger a dedicated and very versed gaming fanatic went through simply to change his clothes in an environment that is meant to be friendly, welcoming, and supportive of those who wish to simply experience another non-threatening world. Changing clothes was not meant to be a challenge or a goal within the environment, it was meant to be user friendly and easy to learn for all walks of life. It was not, and currently is still not something I would say is even in the slightest a user friendly experience. The ultimate point of my being able to change my appearance coming from advice from Suzette really was the last straw in my opinion. Not that it was in any way her fault, I appreciated and was very thankful for her help, but if I could spend weeks trying to understand it only for another user to simply explain the oddities associated with it in a couple minutes is incredibly saddening. It means that as simple as it is, and across all of the official&nbsp;<em>Second Life</em>&nbsp;help, no one could have laid it out in an understandable and easy to find way. Thats really a shame, because not only does it highlight poor user interface and design but it also proves that they almost seem to want you to go through pains simply to fit in. It could have been a very easy process, but it wasn't, isn't, and unless huge revisions are made, will not ever be pleasing to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.favbrowser.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/poorwebbrowserui.gif" alt="dilbert ui" width="717" height="184" /><span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I am not sure that the UI was meant to be highlighted in this way, I am sure we used&nbsp;<em>Second Life</em>&nbsp;for this class because it works and because it is the premiere virtual environment at this current point in time, which just makes all the issues that much worse. I would like to take a second to highlight that&nbsp;<em>Second Life</em>&nbsp;is a free experience and that other than an internet connection, much can be done in this environment without ever spending a cent. The no cost structure of course comes with inherent difficulties and smaller design/implementation teams to create this virtual world and user expectancies should mirror those restrictions. That said,&nbsp;<em>Second Life</em>&nbsp;is STILL the premiere virtual world to inhabit.</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">So I was/am frustrated, that is obvious by this point, but I wasn't complaining simply to complain, there is a reason for all this and its design. Most everyone in this class is an Informatics major and furthermore most (I would assume because of the slot it fills for the track) are HCI trackers.&nbsp;As Informatics majors we are being trained to identify and fix potential issues before they become issues on the respective projects we wish to pursue. So in the case of&nbsp;<em>Second Life</em>&nbsp;that says to me either they did not have an Informatics alumni on their design team (or an obviously less skilled UI designer, because we are the best, lol) or they simply did not care about the user experience. I wanted to make this very fleshed out for a reason and that reason is migration/immersion. No one is going to migrate to new, well anything (product/software/place), if it makes our lives harder unless it fills a gap that is not currently occupied by something that does the job correctly. In regards to virtual worlds, the key is immersion, and the less immersed you are the less you care about what happens in the virtual world. It's a sad thing that it took a seasoned video gamer/virtual world occupier/UI critique-er three weeks to simply change from wearing a jacket to not wearing one. If I can perform the action in the real world faster than I can in the virtual world, then I am likely going to lose immersion, stop caring, and either look for another virtual world or choose not to occupy any.</span>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><em>Assigned Reading - Cheng</em></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">In the autumn of 2004, Halo 2 released to the Microsoft Xbox and forever changed the First Person Shooter (FPS) video game culture and user group. There had been a myriad of FPS games released previously that were moderately successful, but nothing in the realm of Halo 2. Even Halo: Combat Evolved (the precursor to Halo 2), though close in sales, did not have the same mass market appeal that Halo 2 had. There is precisely one reason for the amazing success of this game, the inclusion of online multiplayer. Goldeneye (Nintendo 64, 1997) had long before pioneered the early success of console FPS gameplay locally, but as far as console gaming was concerned online multiplayer had not achieved any amount of quantifiable success in numbers. Halo 2 truly changed the game and from that moment forward, those of us who play their video games on home video game consoles were finally part of the online FPS schema.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Upon the release of this game, my friends and myself were thrilled. We had awaited the release of the game with bated breath for years, having all been early Halo adopters, a game that was only available on the Xbox (Microsoft's then new and first gaming console). This game got a number of my friends to purchase consoles, controllers, and internet connections (something still pretty new, where I come from, in 2004). Considering virtually everyone I knew was a console video game player, the internet was very new ground, myself included. With my friends on board and this amazing new gaming community forming en masse, we stepped into the internet age with what is still today one of my favorite games of all time (and similarly one of the best times in my life).</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.343industries.org/forum/uploads/13adf2ca34739abb8cb3d09d94fdc8dc.jpg" alt="halo 2" width="538" height="330" /></span></p>
            <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec; font-size: small;"><em>Halo 2 Cover Art</em></span>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">So why do I bring this up though? Well, with the advent of Halo 2 and the console's new burgeoning internet environment came voice chat. The Xbox was the first home console to truly make internet gaming not a hassle and organized in a way to make it appealing to consumers. Because of this fact and because of the frothing desire to play this new game, which really became the original proving ground of FPS gaming skill, voice chat was widely adopted and used frequently. I had never communicated so much with other people while gaming, and certainly not so over a distance. Things were good and they continued that way for roughly a year or two after the release of the game. But it did eventually dry up for my friends and myself in the voice chat arena, that is the real point on contention I wish to speak about.</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">With voice chat being so new and useful to a team environment, and with Halo 2 being the proving ground of skill that I spoke of before, we exploited the hell out of it. We talked on Halo 2 constantly, planning new strategies and running game plans ad nauseam, often even preferring contact with each other in the game world to the <span>physical</span>&nbsp;world. It had so many new applications and it was so fun to speak to a friend while playing a game from a distance. It was incredibly fun and exciting, almost to the point of if there was no headset to chat you didn't wish to play with the group or frustratingly had to try and relay messages through friends over the phone or by setting up your console in the same room as another friend to get messages across. It really made almost half of the experience of immersing oneself in, and dominating, the online gaming environment.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://teambeyond.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MLG5.jpg" alt="headsets" width="600" height="398" /><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Major League Gaming team making use of headset functionality</em></span></span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Skip forward to the present day, I currently have five video game consoles connected to my living room TV (with virtually every other one released in boxes or in storage), four of them possessing Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) chat functionality. I have headsets and equipment to use them all with voice functionality, but I never use any of them for any of it. So what changed and why is something that was so important before without merit now? Basically the novelty of the use of voice became old and unused. We no longer cared about trying to win every game and give it all we had, it just became to competitive to play in any form of relaxed way and still win like those older days. The feature has changed virtually not at all, and in fact is still an important backbone feature to have, but it has become more of an optional "when you are in the mood" kind of feature. That level of half in, half out immersion between two worlds is incredibly tiring at that level. Your brain is trying to process so much that you become both mentally and physically exhausted. So, just like that (over a relatively short course of time), we slowly stopped using voice chat and have really never cared to use it since.</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">"Women who speak in online FPS games rarely fail to garner attention and excited commentary not least because of how uncommon it is to hear female voices in these environments." (<em>The Oxford Handbook of Virtuality</em><em>, 342</em>) I would like to take a second to point out this sentence, or more specifically the entire paragraph which I will paraphrase throughout this portion of my analysis. I have actually written a paper a few years ago about this portion of the reading, the reactions the overall FPS community had when a woman was identified in the ranks of the randomized group. I found in my personal interactions that most acted overly responsible and tried to protect or help the female voiced avatar. The portion of the text, "communications between players...become unusually chivalrous and polite."&nbsp;(<em>The Oxford Handbook of Virtuality</em><em>, 342</em>), is the exact reaction I have observed time and time again. Spurring conversation and attempting to connect with the female voiced avatar in ways that may hope to spur fondness has been the only reaction I have observed in fact. It is incredible that through the use of virtual worlds, where one is undone and re-made again in 1's and 0's, we return to older fashioned customs and traditions. My theory is that because of the lack of physical connection and the distance of contact (coupled with the capability to leave at any time without the ability to intervene), causes an over-consideration of feelings and increased production of empathy.</span>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;this is also interesting because most gamers these days don't just play a game to enjoy it or to win, they inhabit it and engorge their minds with the possibilities the game world presents. As far as a virtual game world goes, it is not unlike the kids in the 1950's hanging out in malt shops, or kids in the 1980's in a mall,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>'s in game lobbies and multiplayer maps are the hangouts of the 2000's (so far). So when in a very similar fashion it is not very odd of a behavior to attempt to find a new mate in your favorite hangout spot. In fact, if they are there they have been essentially prescreened for compatibility and may be interested in some male attention. That is the vantage point of a male anyways, and though it is not wildly disrespectful or inappropriate (in most cases), it does not mean it has been asked for or is desired. Its ironic in a way that in the attempts to garner a possible female's attention, a male (or other female) may push them away with the perception of disrespect or being singled out.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I fell out of the ship! lol. During this week's class while exploring the cyberspace with Agile Bill I fell out a spaceship and landed on a planet below. I thought this was the funniest thing and eventually made my way back up to the ship and by flying through a nebula and back. Bill showed us alot of interesting things on the ship, which was really cool and well constructed (the star trek touches were appreciated, even though I couldn't get the space suit to overlay on my avatar). It was alot of fun to check out the ship but it also served the purpose of how difficult it is to give a tour, or herd the cats, through a virtual space. Even if a person is trying to engage with the tour medium it is possible for technical or network issues that could cause a person's avatar to prevent a fluid exchange.</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">I enjoyed this week's class, it was very fun and had and inventive feel to keeping you engaged by catering to the possible interests of your class. It made me think of an episode of&nbsp;<em>"The Simpsons"</em>&nbsp;in which Lisa was imagining a classroom that allowed her to follow around Ghengis Kahn and "eat who he eats". lol. Much in the same way alot of classes are referencing trying to foster "Gamification", or the idea of separating and assigning points to assignments in a was to encourage support and growth towards an end goal, the use of entertainment/humor in the teaching process will rub off on a student and instill them with confidence.</span></p>

The assigned reading did a great job of highlighting exactly how people traditionally, and more currently, relate to the idea of an avatar. Most may think that the idea of an avatar may be rather new (generally referring to online avatars), but it actually extends to virtually the beginning of religion or even society. Looking at some entertainment references, in the World of&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;or the Dungeons &amp; Dragons based world of&nbsp;<em>DragonLance</em>, avatars for the gods are used as shells to house their <br />presence on the physical plane. The interesting thing about this reference though, is that each god has various avatars, each with their own backstory, lives, and personalities. It is the exact reverse of how we are trying to understand the use of an avatar in this reading, the diety/god exists on another non-physical plane and inhabits an avatar to exist upon the physical one. All this writing pre-dates the internet in every regard and takes (at least some) of its clues from the original Hindu meaning of a god inhabiting a body on the physical plane so that it can experience or partake in the "real world".</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Throughout the reading I constantly came back to the movie "The Matrix"&nbsp;and how in the movie you would be projected&nbsp;the way you wanted to be. In that movie, the common assumption was that everyone wanted to be wearing black leather and with long coats. It was basically all black on black, but it got me thinking, "Is that what everyone would choose to look like if they could?" I everyone is projecting themselves in very similar ways it seems to indicate that everyone would choose to look this way but its not acceptable in the "physical"&nbsp;world. I know I personally have an affinity for cloaks, or basically&nbsp;just a large piece of hanging fabric to cover the outside of the body. However cloaks are not socially acceptable in many ways and are less useful as they used to be (for shielding the elements and keeping the wearer warm), instead replaced with much smaller, more effective, garments. But what is the real question, "Is it that everyone wants to wear things that are not socially acceptable and black?," or "Everyone who was present in that movie was just the&nbsp;<em>type of person</em>&nbsp;to want to make a statement with their clothing choices?"</span><span style="color: #a6e1ec; text-align: center;">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">These are the things that make me personally reflect within myself, a bridge to pop culture. With a way to attach an idea or ideal to a entertainment reference we suddenly gain more prospective into how we wish, or are being lead to believe that the "cool" way, to represent ourselves in both the physical and virtual worlds. I actually think, because of pop culture, I am actually impressed by how much of our reading seemed obvious to me. I have been so ingrained in this culture for so long, the idea of having a second non-physical being to represent yourself in another place, seems not only understandable, but also commonplace.</span></p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #000000;">(<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Ran</strong></span>: &nbsp;<em>Scarborough and Bailenson are pointing out that your avatar is you. &nbsp;You are your avatar. &nbsp;Where things become apparent is when you move from spatial and personal presence to social presence. &nbsp;So far, your avatar is part of the group. &nbsp;You sense that some people might be observing you, but you have yet to take on the responsibility of getting others to feel like you are using your avatar to make them feel that they belong to your world. &nbsp;This sense of belongingness is part of immersion. &nbsp;I use my avatar and my personality to get people to do certain things in virtual worlds. &nbsp;How do I do that? &nbsp;What influences do I have? &nbsp;How is it that I'm using a 3D 3rd person view of an avatar, while being a deity and controlling the people and the environment around me. &nbsp;As you move further into the class, keep these questions at the forefront of your mind. &nbsp;You will experience things that are virtual. &nbsp;Not commonplace in many ways, because you are a cursor, a projection, a graphic item, an algorithm - how do you make yourself have physical, biological, chemical impact with an avatar? &nbsp;You have to, because our world, our culture, is commodotizing technology to become a utility)</em>. &nbsp;</span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Prior to the first class meeting I was incredibly confused. I signed up for this class without an incredible amount of research into the course load. So when Mr. Hinrichs sent out an email explaining that the class would not be taking place in any physical classroom I went back and looked over exactly what the class was about. lol. I then proceeded to tell my friends and family about this odd hybrid type of class I was in and watched them also become confused and ask lots of questions. I was really unsure what to expect when first logging in, but as far as Sococo goes I find it is not unlike most teleconferencing meetings I have attended previously. Second Life, on the other hand, is incredibly disorienting to me. I found Second Life to be very interesting but also frustrating because of all the options available and all the distracting details available to interfere with&nbsp;traditional learning, yet in&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of ways enhances individual&nbsp;learning. Though I must say, being the only knowledge I had about Second Life was from a short skit on The Office, I kept giggling to myself about flying around the area.<br /></span></p>

            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #a6e1ec;">Upon delving into the required reading I discovered first off that upon first viewing of this class I had missed a few key <img style="float: right;" src="http://www.gamestm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/virtuality.jpg" alt="90s VR" width="446" height="290" />points as to why this was such an interesting field and class. Virtual Reality, to me, has been a bit of a pipe dream my whole life. My father had sort of pushed me into technology early in life and had promised to get me early versions of what seemed to be "right around the corner" technology. Then it seemed like VR just kinda vanished from the popular media, like 3D and parachute pants, only to bid its time for when the technology (and world) was ready for it. It seems to me that some technologies are best applied when the technology has not only caught up to the needed specifications to manage it, but maybe even as that technology begins to age slightly, so as to facilitate developers and consumers with affordable and stable hardware/software. It seems as if we are right on the&nbsp;precipice of Virtual Reality becoming a true reality the way it was originally sold to all us consumers earlier in my life, and the reading has only re-enforced that to me. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

You have experience in this area, and while you have found <em>voice</em> to be at times a detriment, I was touched by your story regarding the instinct to protect an avatar with a female voice. &nbsp;I haven't seen anyone write about "empathy" yet as I go along through the wikis. &nbsp;With your reasoning, what positive outcomes might occur then, if more women were encouraged to use voice in these games?"</p>

                        <p>Ran: &nbsp;I['m curious Patrick. &nbsp;You said the course content and the actual course "unfolding" was confusing. &nbsp;It confused others around you, when you told them what you were doing. &nbsp;In a nutshell, I said at the top of the syllabus, "<strong>This course is designed to give you an immersive experience in which you define what it means to be an avatar in the multiverse. " &nbsp;</strong>Two things pop out to me. &nbsp;The word "immersive". &nbsp;Do I know what that means, I might ask myself? &nbsp;Can I explain immersion? &nbsp;Can I know what it is intellectually from talking about it, or reading about it? &nbsp;Or is it something I have to experience. &nbsp;How do I define the experience? &nbsp;Is it different for me than it is for others? &nbsp;Can I generalize about immersion? &nbsp;The second thing that comes to mind is what is an avatar? &nbsp;Do I understand what that is? &nbsp;Is is digital presence? &nbsp;What is presence? &nbsp;Are others perceiving who I am based on the projection of my avatar? &nbsp;Are all people experiencing avatars similarly? &nbsp;Is there a science to being an avatar, to creating an avatar, to designing an avatar? &nbsp;And finally, what is a multiverse. &nbsp;I can describe a multiverse from an academic point of view. &nbsp;But, how do I move my avatar from virtual world to virtual world, from universe to universe? &nbsp;How do I create an avatar that can jump between realities, and how can I keep my sense of persona, the way I keep it in the physical world? &nbsp;What are the techniques? &nbsp;So, I'm perceiving that confusion, means that there are terms being used that I have to grapple with in order to understand that simple sentence. &nbsp;I challenge you. &nbsp;Will your experience clear up your confusion? &nbsp;Will your experiences be the summation of being immersed for ten weeks with others, as an avatar, in a multiverse? &nbsp;And how will that change you? &nbsp;I can't wait to see Week Ten's wiki. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Suzette: Patrick, from now on we are hoping to see everyone stretch for a "3" and that means connecting directly with excerpts from the assigned text, not just engaging with the overall subject matter. &nbsp;What in the reading resonated with you? &nbsp;Give us a quote (page number) and tell us why it matters (from an HCI perspective) or if you are inclined, push back against points the authors make. &nbsp;Be critical in your reading and your writing! I expect deep insight from a Vet. :-)</p>

            <p><em>Patrick &ndash; I have enjoyed reading your Wiki and your class participation over the course of this quarter. - Jon Allgood, 11/12</em>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Your Avatar</strong></span></p>
            <p>I can relate to your early challenges regarding the manipulation of your avatar&rsquo;s appearance. This was and is something that I have experienced myself. That said I must beg to differ with you on your terminator selection. Everyone knows that the series 1000 was a superior terminator. I did find it a notable observation that your use of the terminator was due, in-part, to the fact that it was more recognizable that some of the your other avatar considerations. It is interesting that in a virtual world, where just about any avatar was possible, you chose to go with one that still had ties to the &ldquo;real-world&rdquo;.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Week 6 : What you missed and Wearables </strong></span></p>
            <p>For week six we went on tours of several areas. Overall, I interpreted the intent of class as being focused on the economic activity that takes place in Second Life. The train station (where you came in) was an area originally owned by someone else and sold to Raven at a considerable loss if I recall correctly. I am not sure if you are aware but Second Life used to have bustling economy where some users made a fortune. One of the most famous is Anshe Chung (you can read about her here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshe_Chung">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshe_Chung</a>).I believe that those days are long gone for Second Life and suspect that Second Life itself doesn&rsquo;t have much time left.</p>
            <p>On the subject of wearables your question of &ldquo;is it something we need?&rdquo; is certainly the one that everyone is trying to figure out. I am a Product Manager for Wearables at AT&amp;T. A big part of my job is to try and understand what people want in a smart wearable device and drive manufacturers and developers to deliver on that want. Based on what you have written in your Wiki it sounds like you agree with many that the Glass product has a lot of possibility, particularly in providing an augmented view of our world. Personally, I am still waiting to see Glass perform some function well enough to justify its existence. You rightly aknowledge the issues Google is already running into as well. Market research performed by my own department suggests that the general public is not nearly as interested in Glass as the tech bloggers might have us believe.</p>
            <p>The Nixie product that you wrote about is an interesting concept. I think you are correct in stating that it could very well change photography as we know it. Last year I was in Manhattan walking the upper west side and happened on the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. This cathedral is the largest in the world (http://www.stjohndivine.org/about/faq). While I was standing outside enjoying the view and snapping a few photos a kid walked up and took a drone out of his backpack. Within minutes he had the drone in the air and was shooting an HD video of the Cathedral exterior. I was surprised and impressed. This kid was getting detailed shots of the exterior sculpting from a direct angle versus the low-upward angle of mine. He was experiencing the site as a photographer in a very different way than I was.</p>
            <p>Anyway - thanks again for your insight and participation in the class (from one peer to another)!</p>

            <p>Louisa: Hi Patrick! I actually read your wiki last week but I didn&rsquo;t respond for fear of giving away ulterior motives &ndash; but now that you&rsquo;ve received your sadly generic holiday exchange gift, I can comment on your profile!</p>
            <p>I think it&rsquo;s a testament to this class that we can all read each other&rsquo;s profiles and get a fairly holistic understanding of the other person. Even though we never actually meet a lot of the people in this class in person (unless we have other classes with them, or make an effort to have in-person meetings), I feel like we get to know each other as much as if not more than meeting face-to-face. Obviously one of the reasons for that is because our wikis are all written down and available to read at any time, but I think it&rsquo;s also because having the screen separate all of us makes us more open to sharing information! (But perhaps that&rsquo;s just me&hellip;)</p>
            <p>It was interesting reading about your perception of your own final tour! I thought your tour went pretty well, actually &ndash; I was curious how one would go on a tour of Google+, because even though I use it a ton, I don&rsquo;t consider it an immersive environment. It was super enjoyable learning about all the different functionalities of Google+ that I never knew about before, like the hats in Google Hangouts!</p>
            <p>Ultimately, I think some of the biggest issues in true virtual immersion these days are issues with hardware. Once we can get past all the lag and the technical difficulties, perhaps WE WILL BE ABLE TO BECOME ONE WITH MACHINES</p>
            <p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">or uh, whatever. &hellip;I&rsquo;ll show myself out.</span></p>
